    <p><strong>Our Mission:<br /></strong></p>

    <p><strong>Our Vision:<br /></strong></p>
    <p>Better health and well-being for all Bangladeshis, now and for future generations.</p> <br />
    
    <p><strong>Objective:<br /></strong></p>
    <p>We are stepping forward with the following objectives:</p>
    <ul class="unordered-list"  style="margin-left:32px">
        <li>Creating an online-based central medical data management system that will provide easy, portable and realistic treatments for all people of Bangladesh</li>
        <li>Focusing on quality treatment with cost effective prices</li>
        <li>Providing experienced doctors that will handle serious and critical patients as well as focus on significant research and development purposes.</li>
        <li>Introducing trust in Bangladesh’s medical system and doctors so that patients do not have to leave the country for treatments</li>
    </ul><br>
    
    <p><strong>About us:<br /></strong></p>
    <p>Many of us are facing challenges in caring for our family members and loved ones. Distance and working lives can make it difficult to focus on family member’s needs and get them the care they deserve. The waiting times in scheduling a consultation with doctors can be frustrating and it’s important to know which doctor will be the best for your specific problem area. Acro Medical is here committed to helping you care for the health and well-being of your loved ones.</p>
    <p>We not only provide home healthcare services but we also specialize in offering personalized assistance in meeting the individual requirements of our clients.

    <p><strong>Management Team and Team Members:<br /></strong></p>
    <p style="margin-left:32px"><strong>Mr. Ariful Islam</strong>, CEO</p>
    <p style="margin-left:32px"><strong>Sungida Sultana</strong>, Head of CSD. Research &amp; Development.</p>
    <p style="margin-left:32px"><strong>Dr. Najnin Ara Najia</strong></p>
    <p style="margin-left:32px"><strong>Mr. Belal Hossain Sujon</strong></p>
    <br />
    
    <p><strong>Significant Medical Area:<br /></strong></p>
    <p>Acro Medical’s main focus is maintaining utmost quality in every stage of service. We are using advanced technology software which will introduce new levels of medical service in today&#39;s competitive environment. Our goal is to operate a successful and cost-effective practice in Bangladesh.</p>
    <p>In developed countries, citizens are assured of their health services by being registered under a healthcare service center. They are typically monitored under a general practitioner and when in need of medical services, notify their healthcare service center and have a general practitioner come to their home to give a consultation. They are easily able to receive services with minimal hassles while sitting in their homes. This is the modern concept of securing healthcare and we are now just bringing this concept to Bangladesh. Our country is a densely populated country and it is difficult to reach hospitals or doctor chambers quickly due to traffic and busy lifestyles. Acro Medical wants to modify the system of healthcare services in Bangladesh and adopt a modern one.</p>
    <br />
    
    <p><strong>Antibiotic Resistance:<br /></strong></p>
    <p>Antibiotic resistance is one of the most critical threats to the public’s health. In some cases, antibiotic resistance can lead to serious disability or even death.</p><br />
    <p>According to WHO the “Global action plan on antimicrobial resistance” has 5 strategic objectives:</p>
    <ul class="unordered-list" style="margin-left:32px">
        <li>To improve awareness and understanding of antimicrobial resistance</li>
        <li>To strengthen surveillance and research</li>
        <li>To reduce the incidence of infection</li>
        <li>To optimize the use of antimicrobial medicines</li>
        <li>To ensure sustainable investment in countering antimicrobial resistance</li>
    </ul><br />
    <p>We want to create awareness for our members on the effects of taking antibiotic without proper diagnosis by their physicians. We monitor our clients on the proper usage of antibiotics, make them aware on the importance in completing the full dosage and educate on the risks of antibiotic resistant.</p><br />
    
    <p><strong>Reduce repeated test practice in Bangladesh<br /></strong></p>
    <p>General or non-medical persons typically don’t have much knowledge on diagnostic tests. Many of us nowadays are facing repetitive test problems in our country. Unnecessary testing can make up a large proportion of a laboratory’s workload. Acro Medical is working to identify the cause of this problem to try and reduce the rate of repetition without reason. Unnecessary testing is happening due to:</p>
    <ul class="unordered-list" style="margin-left:32px">
        <li>Not storing reports properly</li>
        <li>Unaware that a test has been previously performed</li>
        <li>Poor understanding of further importance of this test result in future</li>
        <li>Lack of knowledge</li>
        <li>Physicians often suggesting repeat testing</li>
        <li>Fear of errors</li>
        <li>Patients actively ask for tests</li>
    </ul><br />
    <p>All of the above situations are caused by lack of proper documentation and are leading to financial drawback. Repeat testing test will be reduced by the use of computerized documentation process, general awareness etc. We are working with diagnostic centers that provide repeated test results without associated extra costs if the results are an error caused by the physician. We are keeping records of our members test results in our system and can provide copies of reporting.</p><br />
